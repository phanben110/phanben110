Greetings! Currently pursuing a master's in Computer Science at NCKU, I focus on AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Edge Computing, and Information Retrieval. Originally from a picturesque city along the Huong River in central Vietnam, I've graduated from Danang University of Science and Technology.

I bring experience from participating in the talented AI engineer training program at Vingroup. Passionate about crafting intelligent machines, I've actively participated in domestic and international Robocon events, including ABU Robocon 2020. Eager to explore the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing our lives, I welcome interesting conversations and collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email.
