I am an AI engineer. I grew up in a romantic city located in central Vietnam on the banks of the Huong River.
- ðŸŽ“ I'm currently a final year student at University of Science and Technology - University of Danang, majoring in Control Engineering and Automation.
- ðŸ”­ I am also studying and working on machine learning, deep learning.
- ðŸ¤– I'm a big fan of Robots! I have participated in many robot competitions such as MiniRobocon 2019, Robodnic 2019, ABU Robocon 2020. I really want to create a robot  with artificial intelligence close to human, that's why I decided to focus my research and work in the field of artificial intelligence.

It is best to contact me by [email](phanben110@gmail.com). I am always open to interesting conversations and collaborations.
