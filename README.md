### Hi, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

I'm an AI engineer who grew up in a picturesque city in central Vietnam, located on the banks of the Huong River. I recently graduated from Danang University of Science and Technology, where I majored in Control Engineering and Automation.

My current focus is on machine learning and deep learning, and I'm excited about the possibilities they offer for creating intelligent machines. As a big fan of robots, I've participated in several competitions, including domestic and international Robocon events such as ABU Robocon 2020.

In my work, I'm particularly interested in developing robots with AI that can mimic human intelligence. I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, and I'm passionate about exploring this field further.

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me by email.
